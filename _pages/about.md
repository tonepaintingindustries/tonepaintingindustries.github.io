# About


My name is Zack.

I am a Chicago based creative specializing in music, photography, and videography.

I have over a decade of experience in sound design and audio engineering and extensive knowledge of music theory. I have been doing concert and motorsport photography for two years, specializing in content creation for social media.

Aside from my creative projects, I also enjoy literature and philosophy. I've presented and sat on panels at the [University of St Francis Writers' Conference](https://www.stfrancis.edu/sfwc/) on two occasions. I also have experience in graphic design, video production, and [programming lighting for live performance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veyInHEq7WU)
