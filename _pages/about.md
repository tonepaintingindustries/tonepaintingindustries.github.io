# About


My name is Zack.

I am a Chicago based creative specializing in music, photography, and videography.

I have over a decade of experience in sound design and audio engineering.

Aside from music, I also enjoy literature and philosophy. I've presented and sat on panels at the [University of St Francis Writers' Conference](https://www.stfrancis.edu/sfwc/) on a few occasions. I also have experience in graphic design, video production, and [programming lighting for live performance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veyInHEq7WU)
